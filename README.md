# Github Classroom Exercise:  Dream Restaurant Website

This exercise allows you to showcase your newly acquired HTML and CSS skills by building a website for your dream restaurant!

**Scenario:**

Imagine you're opening your dream restaurant. Create a one-page website to entice potential customers. Use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it beautifully and reflect your restaurant's unique theme and ambiance.

**HTML Requirements:**

* Use HTML elements to structure the website content, including:
    * `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
    * `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
    * Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) for the restaurant name, menu sections, etc.
    * `<nav>` for navigation elements (links).
    * `<main>` for the main content area of the website (menu, descriptions, etc.)
    * `<article>` for individual menu items (if applicable).
    * `<section>` for distinct sections (e.g., Gallery, Contact).
    * `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images and their captions.
    * Paragraphs (`<p>`) for descriptions
    * Images (`<img>`) to showcase your restaurant's atmosphere and dishes.
    * Navigation links (`<a>`) for different sections of the website (e.g., Menu, Contact).

**CSS Requirements:**

* Create a well-structured CSS file (`.css`) linked to your HTML document.
* Use CSS to style various elements:
    * Change fonts, colors, and text sizes for headings, paragraphs, and links.
    * Add backgrounds and borders to sections.
    * Include images with appropriate sizing and positioning.
    * Implement basic layout. (Consider a one-column or two-column layout)
    * Explore basic hover effects for buttons or links (optional).

**Creativity Boost:**

* Choose a specific theme for your restaurant (e.g., Italian, modern fusion, cozy cafe, Chinese,...). Let your theme influence the website's design and content.
* Use relevant images that capture the essence of your restaurant. 
* Experiment with color palettes and typography to create a visually appealing website.
* You can add a short tagline or mission statement for your restaurant.

**Bonus:**

* Implement a simple contact form using HTML forms.

**Github Classroom Submission:**

1. Accept the assignment and click on the generated URL.
2. Clone the repository or Open it in GitHub Codespaces.
3. Create two files in your repository:
    * `index.html` containing your website's HTML code.
    * `style.css` containing your website's CSS code.
4.  Push your code to the master/main branch, equivalent to submitting your work.

**Tips:**

* Refer to online resources like WebDev ([WebDev](https://web.dev/learn)) for HTML and CSS tutorials.
* Explore color palettes from different designers for inspiration or create yours via [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) 
* Explore online code editors like Github CodeSpaces ([GitHub CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)), or offline code editors like ([Web Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)) for a user-friendly development experience. 
* Most importantly, have fun and experiment! 

This assignment allows you to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS while expressing your creativity. Remember, there's no single "correct" answer. Let your website reflect your unique vision!
